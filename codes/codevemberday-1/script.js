/*
The Ten Lines CSS Challenge

What can you do with just 10 CSS properties and the given set of 10 HTML elements?

The rules:

- Don't change the HTML
- No JavaScript
- No linear gradients or box shadows with more than 10 colors
- No CSS reset
- No external sources like images
- Repeated properties count against the 10

Tag your pens with TenLines to join in on the fun! :)

Based on the CSS Haiku idea.
