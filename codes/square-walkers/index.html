TODO:

  2.  UI
  3.  Improve spawning algorithm to only choose from available nodes instead of randomly looping over the whole grid.
BUGS:
  1.  Walkers are allowed to spawn on clearly "visited" nodes.  Maybe due to a race condition where the pathing walker and the spawning walker trigger in an unintentionally asynchronous manner?
  2.  Very, very rarely a node is left unfilled when the drawing concludes.
